## Reflection

1. Identify one problem you encountered in this unit
   - WHile I was working on the 2048 game, one problem that I encountered was that the grids and tiles didn't show up as expected. I checked all the codes and I found a tiny mistake, which I didn't put [] in javascript so I fixed and it worked well. 

2. How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude.
   - I thought computers were even easier to use than I thought they were. For example,　I learned keyboard shortcuts as I coded, and they have been very helpful when doing my regular school assignments.
   - ⏬ there are some shortcuts that I learned
      - Command-Z: Undo the previous command. 
      - Command-A: Select All items.
      - Command-F: Find items in a document or open a Find window.
      - Command-G: Find Again: Find the next occurrence of the item previously found.
      - Command-H: Hide the windows of the front app. 
      - Command-M: Minimize the front window to the Dock. 
      - Command-O: Open the selected item, or open a dialog to select a file to open.
      - Command-P: Print the current document.
      - Command-S: Save the current document.
      - Command-T: Open a new tab.
      - Command-D: Duplicate the selected files.
      - Command-E: Eject the selected disk or volume.
      - Command-F: Start a Spotlight search in the Finder window.
      - Command-I: Show the Get Info window for a selected file.
    
3. What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class.
   - Since I knew Html, css and javascript from last year, something new to me was C. It took time to get used to it, but this skill allows me to write more efficient programs by directly controlling calculation. 
   - I also think I understand codes better than last year. I was really strugling with Javascript last year and didn't know how to use it properly, but now I can use it to code games and calculator. 

4. In what ways do computers improve our lives?
   - Computers allow us to have change the way we work. Thanks to computers, we can work from home flexibly, such as when we are busy raising children or caring for family members, and we also do not have to go to the office at all. Also, computers enable instant communication through email, messaging apps, social media, and video calls, connecting people globally. So even though I'm in Jordan I can stll keep in touch with my friends in Japan.
   
5. In what ways would our lives be improved by removing computers from our lives? Explain
   - These days, many people become addicted to the Internet by looking at computers all day long, so I think that if computers were eliminated, people would look more to the outside world and realize the joy of face-to-face conversations with others.　Also, I think our eyes will be better as well since we won't be looking at a screen all day.
   
6. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way?
   - Yes. This class has broadened my future options by teaching me how to code.　I don't know now, but I think what I learned here will be of great help to me if I want to work in the coding field in the future. Even if I don't work in the coding field, I think it will be very useful when I am asked to create a website for my friend's company.
