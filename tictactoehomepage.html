      <h2>History</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Tic_tac_toe.svg/1920px-Tic_tac_toe.svg.png" style="width: 30%;">
      <p>The very first traces of tic-tac-toe go back to Egypt, which has remnants of 3x3 game boards on roofing tiles from 1300 BCE. Other variations included the terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) from the Roman Empire, three men’s morris from various parts of Asia, and Picaria from Native Americans. The name “tic-tac-toe” came about when the British name of “noughts (zero) and crosses” was first printed in a scholarly journal in 1858. This was renamed “tic-tac-toe” in the 20th century. Furthermore, this was not only a paper and pencil game, but it was also one of the very first video games, specifically developed by British computer scientist Alexandar S. Douglas in 1952. And in 1975, MIT students developed a perfect tictac-toe game using a Tinkertoy computer. This is currently showcased in the Museum of Science in Boston.</p>

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Tic_tac_toe.svg/1920px-Tic_tac_toe.svg.png" style="width: 30%;">
      <p>The basic strategies are as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>If a player has two in a row, they can mark the third to get three in a row</li>
        <li>If a player has two in a row, the opponent can mark the third to block the player from getting a three in a row</li>
        <li>Make an opportunity to form two rows with two marks each that are not blocked - this is known as the fork strategy</li>
      </ol> 
         The best chance for a player to win is by using the fork strategy. I will demonstrate the possible fork strategies and the possible blocks that the opponent can use.</p>

    <h2>Name</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Tic_tac_toe.svg/1920px-Tic_tac_toe.svg.png" style="width: 30%;">
    <p> In American English, the game is known as "tic-tac-toe". It may also be spelled "tick-tack-toe", "tick-tat-toe", or "tit-tat-toe".In Commonwealth English (particularly British, South African, Indian, Australian, and New Zealand English), the game is known as "noughts and crosses", alternatively spelled "naughts and crosses". This name derives from the shape of the marks in the game (i.e the X and O); "nought" is an older name for the number zero, while "cross" refers to the X shape. While the term "nought" is now less commonly used, the name "noughts and crosses" is still preferred over the American name "tic-tac-toe" in these countries.Sometimes, tic-tac-toe (where players keep adding "pieces") and three men's morris (where pieces start to move after a certain number have been placed) are confused with each other.</p>
