        <h2>Evolution of the Calculator</h2>
        <p>There once was a time when written numbers did not exist. Man had only his fingers and toes to use as counting devices — and counting sheep and crops using fingers, toes, rocks and shells will get you only so far.</p>
        <p>So human civilization invented the abacus, which the Computer History Museum suggests is “the oldest continuously used calculating tool aside from fingers.”</p>
        <p>Though still in use in today, the abacus was merely the beginning of mankind’s interest in calculating machines, which have evolved radically over the years. Here we share with you a visual history of some notable calculating firsts.</p>

      <h2>1623: First Adding Machine</h2>
      <img src="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/sites/default/files/uploads/1623_calculatingclock.jpg">
      <h4>DEVICE NAME: CALCULATING CLOCK</h4>
      <h4>INVENTOR: WILHELM SCHICKARD</h4>
      <p>A Brief History: According to the History of Computers website, Wilhelm Schickard was credited with inventing the first adding machine after Dr. Franz Hammer, a biographer of Johannes Kepler, claimed that drawings of a calculating clock had been discovered in two letters written by Schickard to Johannes Kepler in 1623 and 1624. Prior to this discovery, Blaise Pascal, who developed the “Pascaline” adding machine in 1642, was regarded as the inventor of the first adding machine. Schickard's “Calculating Clock” is composed of a multiplying device, a mechanism for recording intermediate results, and a 6-digit decimal adding device.</p>
      <p>Interesting Fact: The letters Schickard wrote Kepler were written in Latin, the international language of science and scholarship in Central and Western Europe until the 17th century.</p>

      <h2>1773: First Functional Calculator</h2>
      <img src="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/sites/default/files/uploads/1773-hahn.jpg">
      <h4>DEVICE NAME: N/A</h4>
      <h4>INVENTOR: PHILIP MATTHÄUS HAHN</h4>
      <p>A Brief History: Hahn aspired to design a machine that would help him calculate the parameters of the clocks and planetariums he enjoyed making, according to the History of Computers website. He based his calculator on the “Stepped Reckoner” calculating machine that was developed by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1672. Hahn’s calculator featured a set of twelve drums in a circular arrangement that could be activated by a crank located in the axis of the drums.</p>
      <p>Interesting Fact: Although the first working copy of the device was ready in 1773, the calculator was not demonstrated until 1778 because of Hahn’s difficulty with the reliability of machine’s tens-carrying mechanism.</p>

      <h2>1961: First All-Electronic Desktop Calculator</h2>
      <img src="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/sites/default/files/uploads/1961_anita.jpg">
      <h4>DEVICE NAME: ANITA MK-8</h4>
      <h4>INVENTOR: BELL PUNCH</h4>
      <p>A Brief History: In 1956, the Bell Punch Co. of Great Britain set out to diversify from manufacturing ticket punches by producing a commercial electronic desktop calculator codenamed the ANITA. According to the Vintage Calculators Web Museum, the vacuum tube–based calculator was released in 1961 under the name ANITA MK-8. The machine featured approximately 170 cold cathode vacuum tubes, a Dekatron decade counter tube and Numicator display/indicator tubes.</p>
      <p>Interesting Fact: The acronym ANITA was intended only for internal use during the development of the machine, but the name was so ingrained by the time the calculator was ready for production that the company stuck with it. The acronym has been said to stand for “A New Inspiration to Accounting” or “A New Inspiration to Arithmetic,” but rumor has it that it's also the name of the designer's wife.</p>
